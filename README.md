# rgb-led-mixer
This Arduino project lets you control a common cathode RGB LED using three potentiometers for red, green, and blue intensity. A push-button toggles the LED ON or OFF using debounce logic. It demonstrates analog input reading, PWM-based color mixing, and digital state controlâ€”ideal for beginners in embedded systems.
